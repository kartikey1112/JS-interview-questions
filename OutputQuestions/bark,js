// A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
// B: SyntaxError. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
// C: "Woof" gets logged.
// D: ReferenceError

// Answer: A
// This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

// A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.
