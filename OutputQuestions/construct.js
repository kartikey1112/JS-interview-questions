class Calc {
	constructor() {
		this.count = 0 
	}

	increase() {
		this.count++
	}
}

const calc = new Calc()
new Calc().increase()

console.log(calc.count)


// A: 0
// B: 1
// C: undefined
// D: ReferenceError
// Answer

// Answer: A
// We set the variable calc equal to a new instance of the Calc class. Then, we instantiate a new instance of Calc, and invoke the increase method on this instance. Since the count property is within the constructor of the Calc class, the count property is not shared on the prototype of Calc. This means that the value of count has not been updated for the instance calc points to, count is still 0.
