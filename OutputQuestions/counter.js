//   Answer
  
//   Answer: D
//   counterOne is an instance of the Counter class. The counter class contains a count property on its constructor, and an increment method. First, we invoked the increment method twice by calling counterOne.increment(). Currently, counterOne.count is 2.
  
  
//   Then, we create a new variable counterTwo, and set it equal to counterOne. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that counterOne points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that counterTwo has a reference to, also apply to counterOne. Currently, counterTwo.count is 2.
  
//   We invoke counterTwo.increment(), which sets count to 3. Then, we log the count on counterOne, which logs 3.
