let randomValue = { name: "Lydia" }
randomValue = 23

if (!typeof randomValue === "string") {
	console.log("It's not a string!")
} else {
	console.log("Yay it's a string!")
}

// A: It's not a string!
// B: Yay it's a string!
// C: TypeError
// D: undefined

// Answer: B
// The condition within the if statement checks whether the value of !typeof randomValue is equal to "string". The ! operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be false, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be true. In this case, the returned value of typeof randomValue is the truthy value "number", meaning that the value of !typeof randomValue is the boolean value false.

// !typeof randomValue === "string" always returns false, since we're actually checking false === "string". Since the condition returned false, the code block of the else statement gets run, and Yay it's a string! gets logged.
