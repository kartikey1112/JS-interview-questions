const user = {
	email: "my@email.com",
	updateEmail: email => {
		this.email = email
	}
}

user.updateEmail("new@email.com")
console.log(user.email)

// A: my@email.com
// B: new@email.com
// C: undefined
// D: ReferenceError

// Answer: A
// The updateEmail function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the user object. This means that the this keyword is not referring to the user object, but refers to the global scope in this case. The value of email within the user object does not get updated. When logging the value of user.email, the original value of my@email.com gets returned.
