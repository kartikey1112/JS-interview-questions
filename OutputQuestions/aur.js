const one = false || {} || null;
const two = null || false || '';
const three = [] || 0 || true;

console.log(one, two, three);




// A: false null []
// B: null "" true
// C: {} "" []
// D: null null true
























// Answer

// Answer: C
// With the || operator, we can return the first truthy operand. If all values are falsy, the last operand gets returned.

// (false || {} || null): the empty object {} is a truthy value. This is the first (and only) truthy value, which gets returned. one is equal to {}.

// (null || false || ""): all operands are falsy values. This means that the last operand, "" gets returned. two is equal to "".

// ([] || 0 || ""): the empty array[] is a truthy value. This is the first truthy value, which gets returned. three is equal to [].
